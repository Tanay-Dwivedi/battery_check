# battery_check


In simple terms, the Android app monitors the device's battery level and displays it as a percentage in a full-screen view. It achieves this by using a BroadcastReceiver to listen for changes in the battery status. When the battery level changes, the app updates a TextView on the screen with the current battery percentage. The app ensures a full-screen display by setting specific window flags.
